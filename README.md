# Arduino Timer

This arduino project is inspired by the "Arduino Projects Book" project 8 by Scogg Fitzgerald and Michael Shiloh. This project uses simple light nodes to indicate intervals of time divisable by 6 and will use a piezo to sound off a catchy Mario jingle. In addition, a tactile switch is used to reset the timer and start over. Time intervals is noted in miliseconds and can be extend or trim the timer.
