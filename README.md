# Arduino Timer

This arduino project is inspired by the "Arduino Projects Book" and is project 8. This project uses simple light nodes to indicate intervals of time divisable by 6 and will use a piezo to sound a catchy jingle. In addition, a tactile switch is used to reset the timer and start over. Time intervals is noted in miliseconds and can be edited to speed up or slow down the timer.
